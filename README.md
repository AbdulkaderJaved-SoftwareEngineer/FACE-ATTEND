# FACE-ATTEND
I have updated the code on 4th March 2022

Face Attendance project

I have Updated the code  and added the new Feature called SnackBar instead of toast for attendance completion alert

This is SnackBar code can be seen in the def att function
It can be only be visualize once you give the attendance 
So it check it out by just pasting this code in your project's main_kivy.py file and directly give the attendance
